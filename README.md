## Introduction
The fingerPrinterProject_ICE48D is a software application designed to manage user identities and associated fingerprint data. It allows users to enroll their fingerprints and the code number we get from the fingerprinter, we use it to add users with that code Number, and using the software we can add the details once you add a new user. 

Every time user read the finger details the user shows the following details.
        1. **Name**
        2. **Index**
        3. **Index**
